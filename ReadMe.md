This repo contains the code for few of the tests I conducted relating to Quantum Computing Algorithms.

One of the most promising applications of quantum computing is in the simulation of quantum physics, which is known to be a computationally difficult problem. Using classical computers, calculating the quantum state of an N-particle system requires resources that scale exponentially with N, making the problem intractable at the level of 30 or 40 particles. However, using quantum computers one can calculate various properties of the system, such as the time dynamics with an exponential speedup.
